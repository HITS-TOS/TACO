# Multivariate effective sample size
# ==================================

# Reference https://research-engine.appspot.com/5898535211892736/bibliography/170001
#
# Define a *multivariate effective sample size* (mESS) as:
#
# mESS = n (det(Lambda)|det(Sigma))^{1/p}
#
# where n is the number of samples, Lambda is the covariance matrix of the MCMC chain,
# Sigma is the asymptotic covariance matrix in the *central limit theorem* (CLT)
# and p is the number of quantities estimated. The asymptotic matrix Sigma can be estimated
# by *batch means*. A stopping criteria can be defined when
#
# mESS >=  (2^{2/p} pi chi^2_{1-\alpha,p} ) / ([p Gamma(p/2)]^{2/p} epsilon^2)
#
# with Gamma being the gamma function, alpha the confidence estimate, chi^2 $ the chi square
# quantile function and epsilon is the tolerance accepted as the Monte-Carlo error.
